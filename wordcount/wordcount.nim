NAME
 wc â€“ word, line, character, and byte count
SYNOPSIS
 wc [-clmw] [file ...]

The following options are available:
-c      The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output.  This will cancel out any
        prior usage of the -m o
-l      The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard o
-m      The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard output.  If the current locale
        does not support multibyte characters, this is equivalent to the -c option.  This will cancel out any
        prior usage of the -c o
-w      The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output.
